# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Overview of the project
This project was designed to show varius earthquake data derived from the USGS at https://earthquake.usgs.gov/ this site houses the data for the magnitude 4.5 or greater in the past week as well as the data for all earthquakes in the past 7 days (Project final date is December 20th for the images below). This project introduced leaflet and Mapbox.

## Resources
To build this project the following resources were used: VS Code version 1.62.3, Leaflet JS, Mapbox, Notepadd ++, v8.1.9, HTML, Chrome Browser verision 96.0.4664.45, JavaScript ES9, D3, and Bootstrap.

## Results
The index.html page "Earthquakes -past 7 days". Contains 4 maps: there is a Streets view, Satellite Street View, Outdoors view and a Night Navigation view. There are 3 map layers one for Earthquakes, the Tectonic Plates and Major Earthquakes.

There are popups for each earthquake showing the magnitude and location.

There is a color legend in the bottom right that shows the intensity of the earthquake by color. This has been modified to add one more additional color for those earthquakes greater than 6 magnitude.

Below is a world view of the project. There was an adjustment to the cetner of the map giving a better balance to the page.

## Conclusion
The analysis was very timely as there were some major earthquakes that occured in the past 7 days. This project could be inhanced by adding a date layer allowing for longer timeperiod. The map can be modified to move by clicking on an area. Another suggestion would be to click and receive news articles on the major earthquakes. The Analysis did vary slightly from the assignment to add the additional color to the legend and the additional map selection.
